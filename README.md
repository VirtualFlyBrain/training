# VFB training
This is a project containing iPython notebooks to support the Virtual Fly Brain "Hacking the connectome" workshop in collaboration with the Drosophila Connectomics Group based at the Dept of Zoology, University of Cambridge.

All notebooks used in this workshop were combined and published on deepnote: https://deepnote.com/publish/8b59cf44-e41d-44a7-aae9-ae0c365fdace 

This repository will focus on the use of the python [API tools](https://github.com/VirtualFlyBrain/training/blob/main/presentations/tools_landscape.md) and parallels [a similar](https://github.com/VirtualFlyBrain/natworkshop) repo containing exercises for R.
