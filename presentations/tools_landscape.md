# Tools landscape
There are multiple tools to query the various data sources. Fortunately
they play together nicely. Here is a quick overview:

Below are brief descriptions of the libraries/packages. For details, I defer
to their respective (excellent) documentations.

## Querying VFB
Queries against VFB's REST API are easiest with
[`vfb_connect`](https://github.com/VirtualFlyBrain/VFB_connect) for Python.
For R there is a `vfb_connect` wrapper ,
[`vfbconnectr`](https://github.com/jefferis/vfbconnectr) using reticulate.
See also David's presentation for details.

## R
In R the [natverse](http://natverse.org) is your one-stop-shop for all things
neuron: it's a collection of various R packages that are built on top of
the **n**euro**a**natomy **t**oolbox, `nat`. Of particular relevance for
this workshop:

1. [`nat`](http://natverse.org/nat/) is a general purpose library for working
   with morphological neuron data. In this workshop, we make heavy use of
   `nat`'s plotting capabilities but its capabilities extend far beyond that.
    If you want to run any morphological analysis, I highly recommend
   you have a look at the "Articles" in nat's [doc](http://natverse.org/nat/).
2. [`neuprintr`](http://natverse.org/neuprintr/reference/) and
   [`hemibrainr`](http://natverse.org/hemibrainr/) provide an interface with
   neuprint and the Janelia hemibrain dataset
   ([link](https://neuprint.janelia.org)). The former lets you run queries
   against neuprint's neo4j database while the latter contains meta data
   and various convenience functions to work with the hemibrain dataset.
3. [`rcatmaid`](http://natverse.org/rcatmaid/) provides an interface with
   CATMAID servers such as those the VFB uses to host published from the
   FAFB or larval fruit fly dataset.    

## Python
In Python we packages analogous to those in R:

1. [`navis`](https://navis.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) is `nat`'s serpentine
   sibling: a general purpose neuron library for visualization and analysis
   of neuronal morphologies. It also features interfaces e.g. with
   [Blender 3D](https://www.blender.org) and the `natverse` via `rpy2`.
2. [`python-neuprint`](https://github.com/connectome-neuprint/neuprint-python)
    is a Python library to interface with neuprint maintained by Janelia. Note
    that `navis` wraps this library and adds some convenience functions.
    See [this](https://navis.readthedocs.io/en/latest/source/tutorials/neuprint.html) tutorial.
3. [`pymaid`](https://pymaid.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) lets you interface with
    CATMAID servers. Note that due to a name clash the library is called
    `python-catmaid` on PyPI.


## Noteworthy mentions
There are a few more packages/functions that you might hear of over the course
of the workshops.

### NBLAST
NBLAST is an algorithm that computes morphological similarity between neurons
([Costa et al., 2016](https://www.cell.com/neuron/fulltext/S0896-6273(16)30265-3?_returnURL=https%3A%2F%2Flinkinghub.elsevier.com%2Fretrieve%2Fpii%2FS0896627316302653%3Fshowall%3Dtrue)). This has proven incredibly useful to find similar
neurons across data sets but also to cluster neurons into cell types.

On the R side the algorithm is implemented in
[`nat.nblast`](https://natverse.github.io/nat.nblast/) and in Python it is
part of `navis` ([tutorial](https://navis.readthedocs.io/en/latest/source/tutorials/nblast.html)).

### Transforms
You will note that neurons pulled from VFB are typically in the same
template space which makes co-visualization of neurons from different
datasets a breeze. If you want to transform spatial data between
template brains, e.g. from FAFB ("FAFB14") to hemibrain ("JRCFIB2018F"), you
should look for [`nat.flybrains`](https://natverse.github.io/nat.flybrains/)
and [`nat.jrcbrains`](https://github.com/natverse/nat.jrcbrains) in R, and
[`navis-flybrains`](https://github.com/schlegelp/navis-flybrains) in Python.
